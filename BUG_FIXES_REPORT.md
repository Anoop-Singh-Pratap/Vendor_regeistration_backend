# Bug Fixes Report - Vendor Registration System

## Overview
This report documents 3 critical bugs found in the vendor registration system codebase and the fixes applied to resolve them. The bugs range from performance issues to security vulnerabilities and logic errors.

## Bug 1: Memory Leak in Rate Limiter (Performance Issue)

### **Issue Description**
The rate limiter implementation in `src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts` had significant memory management issues that could lead to memory exhaustion in high-traffic scenarios.

### **Root Cause**
1. **Unbounded Memory Growth**: The `submissionTracker` and `emailTracker` Maps could grow indefinitely without bounds checking
2. **Inefficient Cleanup Logic**: The cleanup function had flawed logic that didn't properly handle `blockedUntil` entries
3. **Infrequent Cleanup**: Cleanup only ran every 10 minutes, allowing memory to accumulate rapidly under heavy load
4. **Poor Blocked Entry Management**: Entries with `blockedUntil` weren't properly cleaned up even after block expiry

### **Impact**
- **High**: Memory exhaustion could crash the application under heavy load
- **Performance degradation** as memory usage increases
- **Denial of Service** potential if memory limits are exceeded
- **Scalability issues** in production environments

### **Fix Applied**
1. **Added Memory Bounds Checking**: Implemented `MAX_TRACKER_ENTRIES` constant (10,000) with automatic cleanup when exceeded
2. **Improved Cleanup Logic**: Enhanced the cleanup function to properly handle both window expiry and block expiry conditions
3. **Increased Cleanup Frequency**: Reduced cleanup interval from 10 minutes to 5 minutes
4. **Added Proactive Memory Management**: Implemented `enforceTrackerLimits()` function that removes oldest entries when limits are reached
5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Added logging for tracker sizes and cleanup operations

### **Code Changes**
```typescript
// Added memory bounds checking
const MAX_TRACKER_ENTRIES = 10000;

// Enhanced cleanup logic
const windowExpired = now - tracker.firstSubmission > IP_WINDOW;
const blockExpired = !tracker.blockedUntil || now > tracker.blockedUntil;

if (windowExpired && blockExpired) {
  submissionTracker.delete(ip);
  cleanedIps++;
}
```

## Bug 2: Security Vulnerability in File Upload (Security Issue)

### **Issue Description**
The file upload validation in `src/routes/vendorRoutes.ts` was insufficient and vulnerable to multiple attack vectors, including malicious file uploads and polyglot attacks.

### **Root Cause**
1. **MIME Type Spoofing**: Only checked MIME types without validating actual file content
2. **Missing Magic Number Validation**: No file header validation to ensure files match their declared types
3. **Polyglot Attack Vulnerability**: Files with valid MIME types could contain malicious content
4. **Inadequate Security Scanning**: No detection of embedded executables or malicious patterns
5. **Path Traversal Vulnerability**: Insufficient filename validation

### **Impact**
- **Critical**: Potential for malicious file uploads that could compromise server security
- **Data Breach Risk**: Malicious files could be used to extract sensitive information
- **Code Execution Risk**: Embedded executables could potentially be executed
- **Reputation Damage**: Security breaches could damage company reputation

### **Fix Applied**
1. **Magic Number Validation**: Added comprehensive file header validation using magic numbers for all supported file types
2. **Content Security Scanning**: Implemented detection of executable signatures and suspicious patterns
3. **Enhanced Filename Validation**: Added checks for path traversal attempts, null bytes, and control characters
4. **Text File Security**: Added pattern matching for suspicious JavaScript/VBScript content in text files
5. **ZIP Bomb Protection**: Added compression ratio checks for Office documents
6. **Polyglot Detection**: Implemented multi-layer validation to detect files with mismatched content and MIME types

### **Code Changes**
```typescript
// Magic number validation
const magicNumbers: Record<string, number[][]> = {
  'application/pdf': [[0x25, 0x50, 0x44, 0x46]], // %PDF
  'image/jpeg': [[0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF]], // JPEG
  // ... other file types
};

// Security checks for executables
const executableSignatures = [
  [0x4D, 0x5A], // MZ header (PE executables)
  [0x7F, 0x45, 0x4C, 0x46], // ELF header
  // ... other executable signatures
];
```

## Bug 3: Logic Error in Country Validation (Logic Error)

### **Issue Description**
The country validation logic in `src/controllers/vendorController.ts` had a critical flaw where custom country fields were not properly validated when users selected "others" as their country.

### **Root Cause**
1. **Incomplete Validation Rules**: No validation for custom country fields when `country` is set to "others"
2. **Missing Required Field Enforcement**: Custom country name and code weren't enforced as required
3. **Inconsistent Data Sanitization**: Custom fields weren't properly cleaned when not needed
4. **No Conflict Detection**: Custom country codes could conflict with existing country codes
5. **Poor Error Handling**: Users received generic errors instead of specific validation messages

### **Impact**
- **Medium**: Data integrity issues with incomplete country information
- **User Experience**: Confusing error messages for users
- **Data Quality**: Inconsistent country data in the database
- **Business Logic Errors**: Incorrect country processing in downstream systems

### **Fix Applied**
1. **Enhanced Validation Rules**: Added custom validators for `customCountry` and `customCountryCode` fields
2. **Conditional Validation**: Implemented logic to enforce custom fields only when `country` is "others"
3. **Format Validation**: Added regex validation for country code format (2-5 alphabetic characters)
4. **Conflict Detection**: Added checks to prevent custom country codes from conflicting with existing ones
5. **Data Sanitization**: Enhanced sanitization to clear custom fields when not applicable
6. **Comprehensive Country Validation**: Added `validateCountryData()` function with detailed error messages

### **Code Changes**
```typescript
// Enhanced validation rules
body('customCountry').custom((value, { req }) => {
  if (req.body.country === 'others') {
    if (!value || value.trim().length < 2 || value.trim().length > 100) {
      throw new Error('Custom country name is required and must be between 2-100 characters when "Others" is selected');
    }
  }
  return true;
}),

// Conflict detection
if (validCountryCodes.includes(vendorData.customCountryCode.toLowerCase())) {
  return { isValid: false, error: 'Custom country code conflicts with existing country codes. Please use a different code.' };
}
```

### **Security Testing**
- Attempt to upload various malicious file types
- Test polyglot attacks with files containing mixed content
- Verify path traversal protection

### **Validation Testing**
- Test country validation with various input combinations
- Verify custom country field requirements
- Test edge cases in country code validation

---

## Monitoring and Alerting

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Track memory usage of rate limiter maps
- Monitor cleanup operation frequency and effectiveness
- Alert on memory threshold breaches

### **Security Monitoring**
- Log all file upload attempts and validation results
- Monitor for suspicious upload patterns
- Alert on security validation failures

### **Data Quality Monitoring**
